# run_analysis.R
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. In this repo you will find:
1. run_analysis.R: my script for performing the following analysis on data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip:
    a. merges the training and test sets to create one data set
    b. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
    c. uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    d. appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
    e. from the data set above, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. CodeBook.md: my code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transfromations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
